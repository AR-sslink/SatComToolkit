# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the SatComToolkit repository, please follow these steps to report it responsibly:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Avoid public disclosure of the vulnerability until it has been addressed by the maintainers.

2. **Create a Security Issue**: Open a new issue on GitHub with the following details:
   - A clear and descriptive title.
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce (if applicable).
   - Information about the environment, versions, and configurations where the vulnerability exists.
   - Attach any relevant evidence such as logs or screenshots.

3. **Contact the Maintainers**: If you're concerned about the security issue's visibility, you can contact the repository maintainers directly via email (provide an email address in the repository's README or elsewhere) with the same details mentioned above.

4. **Response Time**: The maintainers will acknowledge the issue and aim to respond promptly.

## Vulnerability Handling

- Once the vulnerability is reported, the maintainers will assess its severity and impact.
- The maintainers will work on a fix or mitigation strategy.
- A fix will be developed and tested as quickly as possible.
- A new release containing the fix will be published.
- Vulnerability reporters will be credited for their responsible disclosure unless they request anonymity.

## Supported Versions

The security policy applies to the latest release of the SatComToolkit repository. Users are encouraged to keep their installations up to date with the latest versions to benefit from security updates.

## Disclaimer

The SatComToolkit maintainers appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. However, please note that no software is entirely immune to security risks, and open-source projects may have limitations in addressing every issue. Users and contributors are encouraged to follow security best practices and contribute to improving the project's security posture.
