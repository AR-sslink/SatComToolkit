## Introduction

Satellite communication is a fascinating field that plays a crucial role in connecting the world, whether for remote sensing, global internet access, or scientific research. The SatComToolkit repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of resources to help you dive into this exciting domain.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized into several sections:

1. **Documentation**: Detailed information about satellite communication concepts, protocols, and hardware setups.

2. **Satellite Communication Software**: Code and tools for various aspects of satellite communication, including satellite tracking, data modulation/demodulation, error correction, and RF communication.

3. **Hardware Design**: Schematics, designs, and simulations for antennas, satellite ground stations, and software-defined radios.

4. **Example Projects**: Practical examples and use cases for satellite communication, demonstrating how to send and receive data from satellites.

5. **Resources**: A curated list of links to external resources, research papers, and books to deepen your understanding of satellite communication.
